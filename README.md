# Kotoba

`Kotoba` is a `Shadowsocks` like proxy app written in Haskell.
It's still under development.

## Progress

1. Have a very naive encryption.
2. Able to listen to local socks5 socket
3. Able to establish connection between *Local* and *Server* via TCP
4. **NOT** able to perform the `HTTP(S) Requests` either in *Local* or *Server*
